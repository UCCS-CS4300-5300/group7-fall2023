## CS 4300/5300: Advanced Software Engineering
## Project Name: Popping Projects
### Client: Group 2

## Iteration 1 ##
## In this iteration, we added a simple home page view to the project with an explore tab as well as an account tab that we will add functionality to in a later iteration. We also checked with the customer and they were pleased with the outcome of this iteration. ##

## Iteration 2 ##
## In this iteration, the main things we wanted to work on specifically on the backend so we went ahead and worked on a github API. We also created a database. We now have a script that updates the database from github API data. This were a few extra tasks that we thought of before we really get into the customers features. The customer approved of this and also gave us a priority list of features that they feel are the most important to this app. ##

## Iteration 3 ##
## In this iteration, the home page was updated to display the top 10 repositories sourced from our stored database. The functionalities for the explore page and account page were also done. ##

## Popping Projects


## ITERATION 1 ##
In this iteration we began our project by creating the basic setup of our home page. We added a home page view with url patterns so that we can visually see something. Then we went in and did some html to make the home page look nice. Upon meeting with the customer they liked how clean the home page looked in this iteration. One of our devs had the idea of adding an account button and possibly being able to link this with their github account. Our customer liked this idea and we will work on this feature moving forward but that is the purpose of the account tab.
